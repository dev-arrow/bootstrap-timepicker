Help make timepicker better! Contributions are appreciated.

Just be sure to cover any new features/bug fixes with unit tests and 
run the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> script before submitting a pull request. 

Grunt will minify the assets and copy them to the gh-pages branch
so that the documentation is kept in sync. It will also run some 
unit tests to let you know if you broke anything.
